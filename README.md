# pokedex
Pokedex App:

Created a Pokedex to display 718 different types of pokemon in a UIColectionView.

When pressed, another view appears displaying a description and further information for the chosen pokemon.

Dynamically updated the description data for each individual pokemon using Alamofire to parse the JSON data from API source 'pokeapi.co'
