# pokedex
Pokedex App:

Created a Pokedex to display 718 different types of Pokemon in a UIColectionView.

When pressed, another view appears displaying a description and further information for the chosen Pokemon.

Dynamically updated the description data for each individual Pokemon using Alamofire to parse the JSON data from the API source 'pokeapi.co'

Also used AVFoundation for background music.
